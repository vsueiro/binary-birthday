# Binary Birthday ðŸŽ‚

This project explains binary numbers using your age as a starting point.

Here, instead of `1`s and `0`s, we use birthday candles as an analogy. They can be either lit (`1`) or not (`0`).

If you are curious about computer science, this can be a good _(over-simplified)_ introduction to such an fundamental concept.

Hope this sparks your curiosity! ðŸ”¥
